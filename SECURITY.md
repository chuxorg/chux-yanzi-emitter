## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it privately. The preferred contact method is a GitHub security advisory for this repository. If you are unable to use GitHub security advisories, you may contact the maintainers by email.

We encourage responsible disclosure and ask that you provide enough detail to reproduce and validate the issue. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe and work with you on a fix and coordinated disclosure.
